In Shasta, an array (also known as a list in some other languages) is an ordered collection of values. Each value in an array is called an element. You can create an array by enclosing a comma-separated list of elements in square brackets `[]`. An array is a [literal value].

The following code creates an array that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, in order:

<CodeBlock language="shasta">
  {`
[1, 2, 3, 4]
`}
</CodeBlock>

Array elements don't have to be literals--they can also be other kinds of [expressions]:

<CodeBlock language="shasta">
  {`
[
  "abc",
  (add 1 2),
  {|2| (printf "Hello, %s!" [$])},
]
`}
</CodeBlock>

[literal value]: ./literal_value
[expressions]: ./expressions

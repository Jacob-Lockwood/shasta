title: Variable Declaration
---

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.astro";
import InlineCode from "../../components/InlineCode.astro";

A variable is declared with an [identifier], an equal sign `=`, and an [expression]. For example:

<CodeBlock language="shasta">
  {`
my_variable = 1
abc = "abc"
my_function = {|2| (+ $ $1)}
result = (my_function my_variable abc)
`}
</CodeBlock>

In Shasta, all variables are constants, meaning they cannot be re-assigned.

[identifier]: ./identifier
[expression]: ./expression

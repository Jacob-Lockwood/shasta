# Your first Shasta program

Before writing your first Shasta program, make sure that you've either [installed Shasta] or taken a look at [the playground].

Create a file `helloworld.shasta` with the following content:

<CodeBlock language="shasta">
  {`
; helloworld.shasta
(print "Hello, World!")
`}
</CodeBlock>

[installed Shasta]: ./0-getting-started
[the playground]: /playground

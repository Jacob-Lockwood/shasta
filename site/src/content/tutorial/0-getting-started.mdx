# Getting started with Shasta

Welcome to the Shasta programming language!

While you're getting started, I recommend trying out the [Shasta Playground](../playground) to try Shasta out online. It's built to let you experiment with the language with an interface that lets you explore its features.

You must have [Node.js] installed on your machine to run Shasta. Once you have that, you can install Shasta off of NPM, and run the compiler using the CLI:

<CodeBlock language="sh">

npm install shasta-lang -g
shasta-lang < filename.shasta > output.js

</CodeBlock>

<Info type="info">A REPL for Shasta is coming soon!</Info>

<Info type="warn">
  The Shasta language is still in very early development; don't try to use it in
  any kind of production environment yet.
</Info>

# Getting started with Shasta

Welcome to the Shasta programming language!

While you're getting started, I recommend trying out the [Shasta Playground](../playground) to try Shasta out online. It's built to let you experiment with the language with an interface that lets you explore its features.

You can install Shasta off of NPM, and run the compiler using the CLI:

<CodeBlock language="sh">

npm install shasta-lang -g
shasta-lang < filename.shasta > output.js

</CodeBlock>

<Info type="warn">
  The Shasta language is still in very early development; don't try to use it in
  any kind of production environment yet.
</Info>
